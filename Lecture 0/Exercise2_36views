My solution to the following queries:

https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2023/psets/0/views/


1 - write a SQL query that a translator might take interest in: list, side by side, the Japanese title and the English title for each print. 
Ensure the Japanese title is the first column, followed by the English title.

SELECT "japanese_title", "english_title" FROM "views";

2 - write a SQL query to list the average colors of prints by Hokusai that include “river” in the English title. (As an aside, do they have any hint of blue?)

SELECT "average_color" FROM "views"
WHERE "artist" = 'Hokusai' AND "english_title" LIKE '%River%';

3 - write a SQL query to count how many prints by Hokusai include “Fuji” in the English title. Though all of Hokusai’s prints focused on Mt. Fuji,
in how many did “Fuji” make it into the title?

SELECT COUNT("print_number") FROM "views"
WHERE "artist" = 'Hokusai' AND "english_title" LIKE '%Fuji%';

4 - write a SQL query to count how many prints by Hiroshige have English titles that refer to the “Eastern Capital”. Hiroshige’s prints were created in 
Japan’s “Edo period,” referencing the eastern capital city of Edo, now Tokyo.

SELECT COUNT("print_number") FROM "views"
WHERE "artist" = 'Hiroshige' AND "english_title" LIKE '%Eastern Capital%';

5 - write a SQL query to find the highest contrast value of prints by Hokusai. Name the column “Maximum Contrast”. 
Does Hokusai’s prints most contrasting print actually have much contrast?

SELECT MAX("contrast") AS "Maximum Contrast" FROM "views"
WHERE "artist" = 'Hokusai';
