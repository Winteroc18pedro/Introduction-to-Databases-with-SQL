My solution to the following queries:

https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2023/psets/0/normals/

1 - Write a SQL query to find the normal ocean surface temperature in the Gulf of Maine, off the coast of Massachusetts. To find this temperature,
look at the data associated with 42.5° of latitude and -69.5° of longitude.

SELECT "latitude", "longitude", "0m" FROM "normals"
WHERE "latitude" = 42.5
AND "longitude" = -69.5;

2 - Write a SQL query to find the normal temperature of the deepest sensor near the Gulf of Maine, at the same coordinate above.
The deepest sensor records temperatures at 225 meters of depth, so you can find this data in the 225m column.

SELECT "latitude", "longitude", "225m" FROM "normals"
WHERE "latitude" = 42.5
AND "longitude" = -69.5;


Observations: The surface temperature of the water near the Gulf of Maine is 8.703 degrees celsiuis whereas at 225 meters in depth, the temperature decreases to
7.453 degrees celsius, which is not that big of a difference.


3 - choose a location of your own and write a SQL query to find the normal temperature at 0 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters.
You might find Google Earth helpful if you’d like to find some coordinates to use!

I've chosen the Nazare beach in Portugal:

SELECT "latitude", "longitude", "0m" FROM "normals"
WHERE "latitude" = 39.5
AND "longitude" = -9.5;    

SELECT "latitude", "longitude", "100m" FROM "normals"
WHERE "latitude" = 39.5
AND "longitude" = -9.5;

SELECT "latitude", "longitude", "200m" FROM "normals"
WHERE "latitude" = 39.5
AND "longitude" = -9.5;

Observation: The temperature at the surface is 17.154 degrees celsius (which is warmer than the US) and if I go down 100 meters, the temperature decrease as 
expected. The temperature at 100 meters deep is 14.311 degrees celsius.


4 - Write a SQL query to find the lowest normal ocean surface temperature.

SELECT MIN("0m") FROM normals;

5 - Write a SQL query to find the highest normal ocean surface temperature.

SELECT MAX("0m") FROM normals;

6 - Write a SQL query to return all normal ocean temperatures at 50m of depth, as well as their respective degrees of latitude and longitude, within the Arabian
Sea. Include latitude, longitude, and temperature columns. For simplicity, assume the Arabian Sea is encased in the following four coordinates:
20° of latitude, 55° of longitude
20° of latitude, 75° of longitude
0° of latitude, 55° degrees of longitude
0° of latitude, 75° degrees of longitude

SELECT "latitude", "longitude", "50m" FROM normals
WHERE ("latitude" BETWEEN 0 AND 20) AND ("longitude" BETWEEN 55 AND 75);

7 - Write a SQL query to find the average ocean surface temperature, rounded to two decimal places, along the equator. Call the resulting column “Average 
Equator Ocean Surface Temperature”.
The equator’s ocean surface temperatures can be found at all longitudes between the latitudes -0.5° and 0.5°, inclusive.

SELECT ROUND(AVG("0m"),2) AS "Average Equator Ocean Surface Temperature"
FROM normals
WHERE "latitude" BETWEEN -0.5 AND 0.5;

8 - Write a SQL query to find the 10 locations with the lowest normal ocean surface temperature, sorted coldest to warmest. If two locations have the
same normal ocean surface temperature, sort by latitude, smallest to largest. Include latitude, longitude, and surface temperature columns.

SELECT "latitude", "longitude", "0m"
FROM normals
ORDER BY "0m", "latitude"
LIMIT 10;

9 -  Write a SQL query to find the 10 locations with the highest normal ocean surface temperature, sorted warmest to coldest. If two locations have the same
normal ocean surface temperature, sort by latitude, smallest to largest. Include latitude, longitude, and surface temperature columns.

SELECT "latitude", "longitude", "0m"
FROM normals
ORDER BY "0m" DESC, "latitude"
LIMIT 10;


Observation: The place with the warmest water is near the Persian Gulf somewhere between Qatar and United Arab Emirates and the coldest water is at Weddell Sea
right above Antartica.


10 - There are 180 whole degrees of latitude. Write a SQL query to determine how many points of latitude we have at least one data point for.
(Why might we not have data points for all latitudes?)

SELECT COUNT("latitude")
FROM normals;


Observation: There are 41088 locations (latitude wise).
