My solution to the following queries:

1 -  Write a SQL query to list the titles of all episodes in Cyberchase’s original season, Season 1:

SELECT "title" FROM "episodes"
WHERE "season" = 1;

2 - List the season number of, and title of, the first episode of every season.

SELECT "season", "title" FROM "episodes"
WHERE "episode_in_season" = 1;

3 - Find the production code for the episode “Hackerized!”.

SELECT "production_code" FROM "episodes"
WHERE "title" = 'Hackerized!';

4 - Write a query to find the titles of episodes that do not yet have a listed topic.

SELECT "title" FROM "episodes"
WHERE "topic" IS NULL;

5 - Find the title of the holiday episode that aired on December 31st, 2004.

SELECT "title" FROM "episodes"
WHERE air_date = '2004-12-31';

6 - List the titles of episodes from season 6 (2008) that were released early, in 2007.

SELECT "title", "air_date" FROM "episodes"
WHERE "season" = 6 AND "air_date"::text LIKE '2007-%';

OBS: I had to convert the data type of the air_date column to a text in order to use the LIKE keyword.

7 - Write a SQL query to list the titles and topics of all episodes teaching fractions.

SELECT "title", "topic" FROM "episodes"
WHERE "topic" = 'Fractions';

8 - Write a query that counts the number of episodes released in the last 6 years, from 2018 to 2023, inclusive.

SELECT COUNT("title") FROM "episodes"
WHERE "air_date" BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';

9 - Write a query that counts the number of episodes released in Cyberchase’s first 6 years, from 2002 to 2007, inclusive.

SELECT COUNT("title") FROM "episodes"
WHERE "air_date" BETWEEN '2002-01-01' AND '2007-12-31';

10 - Write a SQL query to list the ids, titles, and production codes of all episodes. Order the results by production code, from earliest to latest.

SELECT "id", "title", "production_code" FROM "episodes"
ORDER BY "production_code";

11 - List the titles of episodes from season 5, in reverse alphabetical order.

SELECT "title" FROM "episodes"
WHERE "season" = 5
ORDER BY "title" DESC;

12 - Count the number of unique episode titles.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "title") FROM "episodes";

END
